- 👋 Hi, I’m @Stephenvg1 stephen Veg
- 👀 I’m interested in... well my main interest is quantum computing,but I'm really interested in trying to create a way to create teleportation with classical computing and useing the matrix tunnel useing 0,1-1,0 in python this creates 0,0,0 bring it back to the original state now i wanna use this binery algorithm to create the matrix tunnel bevusse it create a quantum inspired algorithm so i wanna use it to create a sevure system thats my goal  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... python matrix chain matrix multiplication and qiskit physics quantum physics bits and pieces  and wanting to learn geberative prompt engineering 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'm looking into this i wanna learn kore about GitHub i can say that bit i can say im willing to learn  and contribute if your willing to work with me i als use ai to cratlft my codes 
- 📫 How to reach me ... stephenvegatheonlyone@gmail.com
